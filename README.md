STAR Challenge
=====================

This repo is work in progress and will record how we made and where we put files for the STAR challenge.

Each subdirectory will contain a certain sample and we will record steps for its generation as well as intermediate data products that are derived from the sample. We currently have the following samples:

- `gaussian-sim-srd-sample` - Gaussian simulations with SRD-like sample
- `cosmodc2-srd-sample` - SRD-like sample from CosmoDC2
- `cosmodc2-redmagic-sample` - CosmoDC2 sample that uses redmagic as lenses
- `dc2-lss-sample` - DC2 sample used for LSS project #91

Under each sample, we record detailed instructions on how to generate the samples as well as carry out a catalog-to-cosmology analysis using that sample. The firecrown parameters are separately stored in the `firecrown-parameter-inference` directory.

To run anything in these directories it is likely that you will need to install [TXPipe](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/TXPipe) and [Firecrown](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/firecrown). We provide simple instructions here to install both, though please read the respective documentation of the two packages for the most up-to-date instructions.
